[django and mysql, html, bootstrap, css, jquery]
To extend my understanding and learning of python, I gained interest in Django and in my free week I understood 
django web framework and developed a small web application which helps to handle expenses. It is not a complete functioning
project, some very basic functionalities have been implemented as an initiative to understand different django framework properties.

I would be working more to make the project efficient and nicer and complete as and when time permits.
